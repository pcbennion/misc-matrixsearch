# misc-matrixsearch
A small project analyzing ways to search for a number in a matrix with specific properties.

The matrix has the following properties:
- Height m and width n, where m ~ n
- All columns are sorted from top to bottom
- All rows are sorted from left to right
- Numbers can appear any number of times

This project will examine algorithms for finding the first instance of a number and for finding all instances of a number.
